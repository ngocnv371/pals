# summary

This is an immitation of the classic game Yugioh Forbidden Memories using the cards from Palworld.

That was our starting point, nowaday generating new cards are not that difficult.

# game rules

- A match follows the list of phases: Drawing, Placing, Attacking
- Each player take turn to go through the phases or end their turn prematurely
- Drawing: the player draw cards from their deck to get 5 cards on their hand, no more no less
- Placing: the player select one or more cards on their hands and a position on their board. If the player selected more than 1 cards then they will be fused into one card. If the selected position already have a card, then that card will be added to the list of fusion too.
- Attacking
  - The player select a card that hasn't attacked this turn on their board and either change its stance to Defensive or use it to attack a card on the opponent's board.
  - When the player has played all their cards, their turn will end.
  - They can also end their turn manually.
- Battle
  - When two card are in a battle, each card will compare their attribute to each other, the greater one will win.
  - Normally the cards will use ATK attribute for comparison, but if the card getting was in Defensive stance then it will use its DEF attribute instead.
  - The lost card will be destroyed and removed from the board.
  - If the result is a tie then if the target card's stance is Offensive then both cards get destroyed, otherwise no effect.
- Fusion
  - When two cards are set to be fused, then based on the fusion rule a new card will be generated if they're compatible
  - Both fusing cards are consumed for the fusion
  - If the fusion failed (they're not compatible), the first card will be discarded
