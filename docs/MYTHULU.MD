Let's work on a character building & monster creation helper. The user will draw some cards which abstractly describe a monster, then based on the cards, will intepret it into a fleshed out monster using the cards as guidance, the same way people playing with Tarot cards.
There 6 type of cards:

1. Elements: The foundation for worldbuilding, magic, science, and authentic awe. Each card includes literary symbolism behind the element so you can layer subtext intentionally into your games or stories.
2. Habitats: External metaphors for internal states of mind. Reveals imbalance in body vs mind, self vs others, survival vs ambition.
3. Characters: Identities—titles, labels, professions—reinforced by how people spend their time. Covers all five levels of Maslow's hierarchy with a diversity of coping mechanisms at each level.
4. Relationships: Conditional connections that describe the flow of energy between two parties. We looked for relationships with inherent conflict, high stakes, and relatability.
5. Traits: Words you didn't know existed, describing real-life phenomena you didn't know were possible. Every trait changes the way your character, creature, or race interacts with the world.
6. Textures: Multi-sensory details designed for impatient modern readers. These meaningful tactile layers change the way characters interact with an object, which can foreshadow, reveal hidden motives, and even impact the plot.

These cards came from hundreds of hours of research. It contains 150 archetypes gathered from the works of Joseph Campbell, Carl Jung, Shakespeare, Homer, Hafiz, Milton, Chaucer, and Diogenes. We gleaned the best of each master's work, then expanded to account for significant characters that were missing.

These archetypes were then modernized with twists from recent masters like Tolkien, Victor Hugo, Chekov, Asimov, Rowling, Moffit, and Gaimen.

After a master list of exhaustive ideas was gathered, the descriptions and goals for each deck were refined using storycrafting principles taught by Robert McKee, Stephen King, Brandon Sanderson, Craig Chalquist, Stant Litore, and Aristotle.

# HOW TO DRAW

Start by drawing something simple. Let’s draw a monster together.

Monster:

- Appearance: 2 Textures
- Habitat: 1 Habitat
- Role in Habitat: 1 Character

Textures change how the world interacts with your monster. When it's fuzzy, we want to touch and cuddle it. If it's a junkyard monster made from rust and razor-wire, we stay waaaaay back.

Next, monsters always have a strong relationship with their habitat. So we draw a habitat to find out where they lurk.

Finally, monsters always exist for a purpose. Find your monster's original role in its ecosystem with a character card. Is a monster starting to emerge? For more detail, draw +1 Element, Trait, or Texture

# Example Drawing:

- Appearance: Origami, Torn
- Habitat: Temple
- Role in Habitat: Scavenger
- Extra: Water

Interpretation: Origami indicates something sacred or ceremonial. In combination with the Temple, I assume my monster was originally a sacred water animal raised in a temple and pampered there.

After an accident disfigures the sacred animal, the temple abandons it in the wild. Since it doesn’t know how to care for itself, it scavenges to survive. The once-majestic creature is scared, confused, lonely, hungry, half-mad with pain... and slowly turning wild.

# WHEN YOU DRAW WEIRD CARDS:

- EMBRACE IT - Often cards that "feel weird" are where genuinely new ideas are waiting.

- DON'T TAKE CARDS LITERALLY - Gem & Crystal can be interpreted as icicles, chandeliers, windows, fragility... Every card has both literal and abstract interpretations.

- LET GO OF REALITY - What you think you know about the world might not be true anyway. Did you know our oceans contain sea sponges that are literally made of glass?

- SLOW DOWN - Don’t draw rapid-fire. Let ideas stew. Read the whole card. Study the picture in detail. What do you notice? Does it remind you of anything?
